We do a Bible study where we go through topics from questions that are asked about the Bible.  

- Questions are asked by people through our official [Discord Server](https://odubibleqna.github.io/discord.html).  
- The questions will be approved by leader(s) and then asked within the meetings.
- Open to anyone and everyone.
